# Symbol Quest - Detailed MVP Requirements

## Market Reality Check

**Competitor Analysis**: Existing apps like Labyrinthos ($5/month), Golden Thread Tarot ($3/month), and Biddy Tarot (freemium) have 100K-500K users but suffer from:
- Generic AI responses lacking personal depth
- Poor card imagery and UX design
- No symbolic reasoning beyond basic meanings
- Limited progression/gamification elements

**Our Differentiation**: Leverage your ontology server's symbolic reasoning + DevLift's progression mechanics + Freeflow's engagement patterns.

**Week 1 Revenue Target**: $0 (focus on core experience)
**Week 3 Revenue Target**: $500 MRR from 100 beta users at $4.99/month
**6-Month Target**: $15K MRR (3,000 subscribers)

## Requirements

### Core Feature 1: Intelligent Daily Draw (Week 1 Priority)

**User Story**: As someone seeking daily guidance, I want a card that feels personally meaningful, not random.

**Implementation Specifics**:
- **Card Selection Algorithm**: Not random. Use simple user input (mood/question) to weight selection
- **Major Arcana Only**: 22 cards, easier to source quality imagery
- **Card Database Structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 0,
    "name": "The Fool",
    "keywords": ["new-beginnings", "innocence", "spontaneity"],
    "archetypes": ["innocent", "seeker", "beginner"],
    "elements": ["air"],
    "imagery_prompts": "A figure stepping off a cliff with a small bag and white rose",
    "shadow_aspects": ["recklessness", "naivety"],
    "light_aspects": ["faith", "optimism"]
  }
  ```

**MVP Constraints**:
- One card per day per user (enforced by date, not complex logic)
- Mobile-first design (80% of tarot app usage is mobile)
- Loading state max 3 seconds
- Offline capability for previously drawn cards

**Success Metrics**:
- Daily return rate >40% (industry standard: 20-30%)
- Average session time >2 minutes
- Card draw completion rate >90%

### Core Feature 2: Symbolic Reasoning Engine (Week 1-2)

**User Story**: As someone who finds generic tarot interpretations shallow, I want AI that understands symbolic depth and personal context.

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Prompt Engineering Strategy
const generateInterpretation = (card, userContext) => {
  const prompt = `
  You are interpreting ${card.name} for someone who shared: "${userContext.mood}" and asked: "${userContext.question}"
  
  Card Symbolic Elements:
  - Core Archetype: ${card.archetypes[0]}
  - Element: ${card.elements[0]}
  - Shadow: ${card.shadow_aspects.join(', ')}
  - Light: ${card.light_aspects.join(', ')}
  
  Generate a 3-part interpretation:
  1. SYMBOLIC INSIGHT (2-3 sentences connecting archetype to their situation)
  2. REFLECTION QUESTION (one powerful question for journaling)
  3. TODAY'S GUIDANCE (one specific action they can take)
  
  Tone: Wise but conversational. Avoid fortune-telling. Focus on psychological insight.
  `;
  return openai.complete(prompt);
};
```

**Prompt Engineering Priorities**:
1. **Personal Relevance**: Use mood + question context
2. **Depth over Breadth**: Focus on 2-3 symbolic elements max
3. **Actionable**: Always include a specific "what to do today"
4. **Psychological Frame**: Self-reflection, not prediction

**Fallback Strategy**: Pre-written interpretations for each card (create during week 1)

**Quality Control**:
- Length: 150-250 words (mobile-readable)
- Readability: 8th grade level
- Sentiment: Balanced (not all positive, not all challenging)
- Personalization score: Include user's mood/question in 80%+ of responses

### Revenue Engine: Freemium to Premium Conversion (Week 3)

**Monetization Strategy Based on Competitor Analysis**:

**Free Tier** (Hook them with value):
- 3 AI interpretations per week
- Basic card meanings
- No history/tracking
- Simple card imagery

**Premium Tier** ($4.99/month - competitive with market):
- Unlimited AI interpretations
- Detailed symbolic analysis
- Full interpretation history
- Mood/question context inclusion
- Premium card artwork
- Export interpretations to journal

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Usage tracking
const checkUsageLimit = (userId) => {
  const weekStart = moment().startOf('week');
  const usageCount = await getUserUsage(userId, weekStart);
  const subscription = await getUserSubscription(userId);
  
  if (subscription?.status === 'active') return true;
  return usageCount < 3;
};

// Conversion optimization
const showUpgradePrompt = (usageCount) => {
  if (usageCount === 2) {
    return "ðŸŒŸ One more free interpretation this week! Upgrade for unlimited daily guidance.";
  }
  if (usageCount >= 3) {
    return "âœ¨ You've discovered the power of AI tarot! Get unlimited access for $4.99/month.";
  }
};
```

**Stripe Integration**:
- Single price point: $4.99/month
- 7-day free trial (collect payment method upfront)
- Webhooks for subscription changes
- Graceful downgrade (maintain history, limit new interpretations)

**Conversion Funnel Optimization**:
- Week 1-2: Focus on product-market fit
- Week 3: Add payment flow
- Target 10% free-to-paid conversion (industry standard: 5-15%)

### Retention Mechanic: Personal Journey Tracking (Week 2 Priority)

**User Story**: As someone using tarot for personal growth, I want to see patterns in my readings and track my journey over time.

**Implementation Strategy** (Inspired by DevLift's tracking):

```javascript
// Data structure for user journey
const userJourney = {
  daily_draws: [
    {
      date: '2024-01-15',
      card_id: 0,
      user_context: { mood: 'anxious', question: 'career decision' },
      interpretation: '...',
      user_reflection: null, // Added later if they journal
      tags: ['career', 'anxiety'] // Auto-generated from context
    }
  ],
  patterns: {
    most_drawn_card: 'The Hermit',
    common_themes: ['career', 'relationships', 'growth'],
    streak: 12, // Days in a row
    total_draws: 45
  },
  milestones: [
    { type: 'first_draw', date: '2024-01-01' },
    { type: 'week_streak', date: '2024-01-07' },
    { type: 'month_journey', date: '2024-02-01' }
  ]
};
```

**Gamification Elements** (From Freeflow patterns):
- **Streak tracking**: Daily draw streaks with visual progress
- **Card collection**: "Unlock" all 22 major arcana over time
- **Insight badges**: "Deep Reflector" (added personal notes), "Pattern Seeker" (reviewed history)
- **Journey milestones**: 7 days, 30 days, 100 days of daily practice

**History Interface**:
- Calendar view showing cards drawn each day
- Search by theme/keyword
- Pattern insights: "You often draw The Hermit when asking about career"
- Export option: Download your journey as PDF/text

**Retention Metrics**:
- Day 7 retention: >30%
- Day 30 retention: >15%
- Average cards per user: >20 (shows engagement)

### OS-Level Asset: Reusable Symbolic Engine (Week 2-3)

**Developer Story**: Build a symbolic reasoning foundation that powers Symbol Quest and extends to Dream Journal Pro, Philosophy Chat, and future projects.

**Symbolic Engine Architecture**:
```javascript
// Core symbolic reasoning types
interface Symbol {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  archetypes: Archetype[];
  elements: Element[];
  relationships: SymbolRelationship[];
  cultural_contexts: CulturalContext[];
}

interface Archetype {
  name: string; // "The Innocent", "The Sage", "The Hero"
  core_drive: string;
  fears: string[];
  desires: string[];
  shadow_aspects: string[];
  light_aspects: string[];
}

// Reusable across tarot, dreams, mythology, etc.
const symbolicEngine = {
  interpret: (symbols: Symbol[], context: UserContext) => {
    // Combine archetypal patterns
    // Weight by user context
    // Generate coherent narrative
  },
  findPatterns: (userHistory: Symbol[]) => {
    // Identify recurring archetypes
    // Suggest personal themes
  },
  crossReference: (symbol: Symbol, domain: 'tarot' | 'dreams' | 'mythology') => {
    // Enable cross-domain symbolic connections
  }
};
```

**Future Project Applications**:
- **Dream Journal Pro**: Same archetypal analysis for dream symbols
- **Philosophy Chat**: Reference philosophical archetypes
- **Life XP Dashboard**: Symbolic life themes tracking

**Week 1 Minimum Viable Engine**:
